I was talking to Gasanj yesterday about life, she was telling me about her expereinces about a wedding she went to,
one of the interesting thing that came out of it was an incident, where she and her brother went to deliver a packet
of sweets to a person's home, and that person asked about when did her brother plan to get married, the point that makes
it interesting is they don't know them well and had some conservation to get to know them, still they were being asked
such a personal question.

This got me thinking about all the time people advice on how to loose weight or how to prevent my ever reciding hairline.
 I got used to this behaviour, but on thinking about it, I realise how rude is this behaviour, and how people 
don't take in account offending the other person or causing discomfort. We all love to advice, even if the other person
is not seeking it, I guess there is a urge to establish position of authority or influence by offering advice to others, 
or simply establish control in order to dominate.

The need to dominate is very much caused by how our society structure make people carve for attention, validation,
and confidence. This need to dominate is also visible in people toning down achievements of other by providing
 examples of people who achieved more.

So to put it in terms of point, don't offer unsolicited advice, unless it's life saving or the person you are offering the
advice has close relationship with you and you know it won't hurt their feelings.

Thanks :)
