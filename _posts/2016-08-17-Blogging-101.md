A few days ago some of my juniors asked some question about linux and have to google all the details ,So then I thought
Why not write a blog that will help all those searching for the same thing and maybe (or hopefully) improve my writing 
Skills .

So mostly my blog will contain programming related stuff (Can post some philosphical stuff though)

So basically I will be writing a new blog per week and few blogs that I have in my mind right now are



1) Json vs ini

2) Getting started with Ubuntu

3) Making a server in NodeJS

If you have any doubt just comment...
